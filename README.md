# Aeon Planner => Personal Planner React PWA

```
Aeon Planner is my personal planner PWA made using React. I made it for educational purposes and for my own use.
It's like Trello + Evernote, or like that post-it mural you've got in your bedroom. It's meant to be simple and 
straight-forward, and I've put some of my own philosophies about productivity. It's not meant to be a Trello or 
Pipefy clone (but it was true in the very beginning).

Some differences from Trello:
- No "to do", "doing" and "done" lists right from the start.
- No vertical lists.
- Position is more important than colors (top to bottom tasks).
- Information (task description, for example) easily visible.
- No teams, obviously.
- Less bloat.
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
